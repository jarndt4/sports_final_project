2019 NBA Finals Prediction
--------------------------

With the NBA season to its half way mark, meaning its time for the NBA expert Prince to dish out his prediction before the All-Star week. We’ve watched Warriors-Cavaliers meet up for four straight years, but with LeBron James in Los Angeles and a host of contenders all throughout the league, there will be a different Finals matchup for the first time in almost half a decade.

*1.	Golden State Warriors
Curry returning back from his ankle injury, Klay Thompson dominating and having Durant who still doesn’t have anyone in the league who can guard him. With the potential of all-star center DeMarcus Cousin returning for his season debut will cause a tough match up for any team in the playoffs.

*2.	Toronto Raptors - The Raptors are on a hot run in the Eastern Conference right now. This is a risky pick due to all the weight on Leonard, but I think he can shoulder the weight and the rest of the pieces are there to make a very good run at championship.

*3.	Philadelphia 76ers
With the addition of Butler who gives mental resilience and clutch solo scoring to a team that has arguable other than LeBron the most single-handed dominant player in Embiid. There is no one on Warriors including Cousins who could stop him.

*4.	Milwaukee Bucks
While many people drool all over the Toronto Raptors and the Boston Celtics the Milwaukee Bucks are quietly going about their business right now with how their superstar Giannis Anteokounmpo (aka The Greek Freak) is playing. But we all know he cannot do it alone.
