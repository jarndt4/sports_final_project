Power Ranking Top Ten
---------------------

Who’s your number 1 for this week? It’s a serious question, because figuring out who should be at the top of these rankings has been relatively tough over the last month.


The Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry's return, along with back-to-back losses by the Toronto Raptors, put the Warriors in a great position to regain the No.1 spot in the NBA Power Rankings. But the battle for the top spot will be even more interesting when the Raptors visit Warriors on Wednesday night at Oracle Arena.
