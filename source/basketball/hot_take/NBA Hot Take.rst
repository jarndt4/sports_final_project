NBA Hot Take

**Will LeBron James miss the Finals this year?**

After the *Los Angeles Lakers* signed LeBron James this offseason, almost everyone felt confident enough to pencil the Lakers into their playoff bracket for the first time in five years. Almost everyone. But could this be the year LeBron miss the NBA Final appearance?

LeBron James has made it to the *NBA Finals* for eight straight years. Ever since his arrival to L.A, expectations have been high for him taking the Lakers to the playoff. Last year James took the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Final with basically no help. This year with the addition of JaVale McGee, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Lance Stephenson, and Rajon Rondo. James will have all the weapons he needs to make a run in the playoff but unfortunately, he will miss the 2019 NBA Final. 

The way things are shaking up in the *Western Conference*, Lakers will have to go through the number one seed Golden State Warriors, then the Denver Nuggets who are on a hot streak, the Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder, and finally the Los Angeles Clippers. LeBron James and the Lakers will find themselves at the bottom of the playoff spot and having to battle their way to the top.
