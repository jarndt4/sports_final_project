While many people have heard of Murray through his football talents at Oklahoma this year, he is also a very skilled player in baseball. Murray was an All-American baseball player and one of the top prospects coming out of high school for the 2015 Major League Baseball draft, but decided instead to be a two-sport athlete in college.

However, he was recently selected as the number 9 overall pick in the 2018 Major League Baseball draft, but he did decide to play football this year instead, and he has a very interesting decision coming up in which he has several options; he could stay and play another year at Oklahoma, and then play in either the NFL or the MLB, or he could just play in the MLB his next year, his current plan with the Oakland Athletics, the team that drafted him. We'll see what he decides.

In high school, Kyler Murray was a five-star recruit across the nation, and one of the top dual threat quarterbacks in the country. He led his team to three straight championships in high school, and never lost a game while starting. He was named National Player of the Year by multiple organizations in 2014. His statistics were crazy, and he was an All-American.

His first year of college, Kyler Murray committed to Texas A&M, but only started for several games at quarterback. Because of this, he quickly transferred to Oklahoma in 2016, but had to sit out for a while because of NCAA transfer rules.

In 2017, he finally got to play for Oklahoma, but only started in one game out of the entire year. While he still performed extremely well, 2018 was his "breakout" year.

This year, Kyler Murray was an absolute monster on the football field. He led the Oklahoma Sooners to a 12-1 regular season, and a bid into the college football playoffs. They look to play #1 ranked Alabama on December 29th for the semi-finals. He is also a Heisman Trophy Finalist, one of three, which is a very prestigious honor.

Here are some of his phenomenal statistic throughout the 2018 season:

================   =====   =======   ==========
Passing Attempts   Yards   Average   Touchdowns
