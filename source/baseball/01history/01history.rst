History
=======

Everybody knows that baseball is America's pastime, but not everybody knows about the history of the sport. 

The first game was officially recorded in 1846 in New Jersey, and the first organized baseball league was created in 1858. Players were supposed to be amateurs, so none of them were officially paid, however, many were secretly paid by sponsors and others. The first all-professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockins, was created in 1869, and didn't lose a single game that year. Because of the lack of competition from amateur teams, the National Association of Baseball Players became the first professional baseball league in 1871.

There were nine teams in 1871, and thirteen by 1875. However, the National Association was replaced by the National League the following year, and there were much more rules and regulations created to follow. In 1882, a second league, the American Association, began to compete with them, and they came together and created an agreement that infuriated some of the players. These players tried to form their own league in 1884, the Union Association, but it failed after one season. 

Then, in 1890, they tried to form a different league, the Players League, but that failed as well after one season. Because of this, the American Association folded as well, and the National Association was the only league left standing. In 1901, the biggest challenger to them, the American League, started to play, and the two leagues co-existed with each other. In 1914, the Federal League was created but went out of business in less than two years.

Baseball took off after this, and has been one of the most popular sports in America ever since. The only other rival to the two leagues since then was the Continental League, which failed but ended up getting the major league owners to expand from 16 to 24 teams.
