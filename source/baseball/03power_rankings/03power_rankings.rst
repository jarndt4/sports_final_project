The Top Three Favorites:
------------------------

#. **Boston Red Sox:**

   The Boston Red Sox were the 2018 World Series Champions, and if they can stay healthy and play to their potential again, they could do it back to back. They will be looking to keep almost all of their key parts during the offseason, most of which are in the prime of their careers, as shown by Mookie Betts winning 2018 MLB MVP. They're efficient, consistent, and deep, which can put them on pace to have yet another 100+ win season at the very least, a very impressive feat.

#. **Houston Astros:**

   With winning only five games less than the previously mentioned 2018 Champion Red Sox, and having the same odds as them to win the 2019 World Series, it's easy to see how the Houston Astros appear on our list as the number to favorite to win the title. Just like the Red Sox, the Astros have incredible depth on their roster, and while they might lose a few players to free agency, most importantly Dallas Keuchel, they'll most likely look to gain some key players as well. Depending on how things turn out this year, they could be a big favorite for 2019.

#. **New York Yankees**

   After being knocked out of the playoffs by their archrivals last year, you can expect to see the Yankees back and better than ever, playing for vengeance this next season with a chip on their shoulder. There's been a lot of talk about possibly signing Bryce Harper in the offseason, which would be a huge bonus to their team, immediately throwing them up into the elite few in the league. If they can accomplish this while keeping the same rhythm as last year, keep your eyes open.
