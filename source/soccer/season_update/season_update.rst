Club Season Update
==================

This section will provide an update at the club level. Even
though there are many countries with top leagues around the 
world, we will be focusing on one of the most popular leagues
in Europe, the English Premier League. This league consists
of 20 English teams, all fighting for a shot at the title. 
Many clubs, though, don't stand a chance at sniffing the
title, so their primary goal is to stay in the league and 
not get relegated. At the end of the season, the bottom 3
league finishers are relegated to England's second league.
Every club plays each team twice: once at home and once away
for a total of 38 games.

Going into the season, 
it seemed to be a two horse race for the title between
Manchester City and Liverpool. However, the rest of the 
teams rounding out the top 6 also have good chances of 
challenging these two teams. Through the first week of December,
however, Liverpool and City remain the only two unbeatens 
in the league. These two teams utterly dominate their opponents
while remaining a solid 8 points ahead of their third place 
challenger, and 10 points ahead of fourth place. 

Here are the top 6 in the table: 

========= ================== ========= ======== ===========
Position   Club               Record	Points   Goal Diff.
========= ================== ========= ======== ===========
1           Manchester City   13-2-0    41        38

3           Tottenham         11-0-4    33        12
4           Chelsea           9-4-2     31        18
5           Arsenal           9-4-2     31        14
6           Everton           6-5-4     23        4
