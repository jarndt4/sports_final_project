Not only is this sport the most popular in terms of number of people 
involved, but it also brings in one of the top revenues professionally, 
behind only the football and baseball. In fact, 5 out of the top 10 
revenue earning professional leagues across the world are soccer leagues:

It is important to note that there is a difference between International
soccer and Club soccer. The table above is a list of Club soccer
leagues in separate countries. So, for example, in England, the Premier 
League contains 20 separate "clubs" or teams such as 
Chelsea and Manchester United. Each one of the leagues above consists of 
club teams. However, a player can play for both a club team AND an 
an international team. Teams such as United States, France, Germany, etc.
are classified as "national teams." A player can play for both club and 
national team, but only the national team where the player has
a citizenship. For example, The World Cup consists of only national teams.
