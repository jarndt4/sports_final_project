There is currently big news in the soccer world. From the hiring of a new
American coach to the most prestigious individual trophy in the world, the 
soccer realm is buzzing over the recent news.

Ballon d'Or
-----------
The Ballon d'Or award is an annual soccer award presented by *France Football*.
It has been awarded since 1956 and is widely regarded as the most prestigious
individual award in the world, or the best player of the calendar year.
Up until 2018, the `Ballon d'Or`_ was only offered
to the best male player in the world. This year, however, it was also 
given to the best female player.

We will start with the women's award. This is the first year that a woman has 
won the Ballon d'Or, so it was a very historic award to win. The winner of 
this award, or the best female soccer player of 2018, is 
**Ada Hegerberg**. `Hegerberg`_ plays for Norway's national team as well as 
Olympique Lyon in France.

For the men's side, there was a big shuffle in the standings from the 
previous 10 years. Each year in the last decade, either Lionel Messi or 
Cristiano Ronaldo has won the award. This year, however, their reign ended
in dramatic fashion. The winner of the men's 2018 Ballon d'Or, or best
men's soccer player in 2018, is **Luka Modric**. `Modric`_ Plays for Croatia's
national team as well as Real Madrid. Here are the standings:

* **Luka Modric** (Real Madrid/Croatia)
* Cristiano Ronaldo (Juventus/Portugal)
* Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid/France)
* Kylian Mbappe (Paris St-Germain/France)
* Lionel Messi (FC Barcelona/Argentina)

These standings are astonishing as this is the first time in 12 years that
Lionel Messi did not finish in the top 3 in voting. Voting is done by national
team coaches, captains, and journalists.

United States Men's National Team
---------------------------------
After missing the World Cup in one of the most disappointing performances
in the nation's history, the `United States national team`_ parted ways with
head coach Bruce Arena last year. Many players were hungry for more success in
the World Cup, other tournaments, and in friendly matches. While calling
for a major reform of the United States soccer system, the USSF
(United States Soccer Federation) announced the hiring of **Gregg Berhalter**
as head coach.

`Berhalter`_ has experience playing at both the club and 
international level, as US soccer legend Landon Donovan has backed Berhalter as
"the right man" to lead the national team through this reform. The future of 
this program looks bright with players such as **Christian Pulisic** and 
**Bobby Wood**, so hopefully Berhalter can lead them well.
