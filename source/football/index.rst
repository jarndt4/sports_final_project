Brief History in America
------------------------

American football evolved from soccer and rugby. The sport indicated a specific
size and shape of the ball, and also added and changed many rules from the 
pre-existing sports. Some examples of rule changes could be: legalizing the 
forward pass and a neutral zone.

Before the league was called the National Football League, it was called the
American Professional Football Association for the 1922 season. In 1966 they 
merged with the American Football League and held the first Super Bowl was at the
end of that season. There have been 52 Super Bowl games since the merging of the
two leagues.

The NFL is the most popular sport in America, and the televised program is one of
the most watched on American television. The four contracted television networks 
that are allowed to broadcast NFL games will pay a combined total of about 4 billion
dollars a year for the rights. Companies will also pay upwards to $700,000 for a
30 second advertisement during regular season games. During the *Super Bowl*
advertisements can average about 5 million dollars for a 30 seconds ad time.
