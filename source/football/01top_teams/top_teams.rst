Who's dominating their divisions?
=================================

As the season nears the end and the super bowl is in sight, what teams are doing
the best? First I will explain how the play off system works before looking
at the current standings of both divisions, after explaining we'll look at the
current standing in week 12 of the 2018 season.

In order for a National Football team to make it to the Super Bowl the team must
make it to the playoffs and progress to the grand final (aka. the Super Bowl).

Each conference gets 6 teams out of the 16 in the conference to play for the 
chance to compete for the Super Bowl title. Each conference gets 4 seeded teams
based on each divisions best overall record. Each division also gets 2 wild card
teams which is 2 teams with the best overall in 2nd place in their division.

During the wild card weekend the top 2 teams in each conference are safe and do
not have to play while the other 4 are not safe. In each conference the top 2
seeds hosts the lowest seeded team in a best of 1 game. For example the 3rd seed
would host the 6th seed game at their home stadium. So the 6th seeded team would
travel to the 3rd seeds stadium for a best of 1 game, loser gets eliminated and
the winner advances.

This scheme is used in both divisions, after the wild card weekend the 2 winning 
teams in both conferences are put up against the top 2 seeded teams in the 
conferences in a best of 1. After this weekend of games they advance to the 
conference championships for a best of one, than the winners of each conference 
play off in the Super Bowl.

Contenders?
~~~~~~~~~~~

In the AFC East the Patriots are looking to win their division with a nice
3 game win difference to 2nd place. While in the North division it could be a 
close call with the Steelers and Ravens, but you can't count the Bengals out 
entirely either since they are only 2 wins behind. The South is looking like the
Texans will win with the same 3 game difference cushion. Now the West looks 
more competitive for the 1st seed since the Chargers and 9/3 while the Chiefs are
10/2. It will be close but both teams are looking good for a spot in the playoffs
due to their good records, one going to be a wild card at this rate.
