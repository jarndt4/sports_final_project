SuperBowl 2019, Who are the top contenders?
===========================================

There are many teams that are possible to make the *Super Bowl* and win it but
this is my opinion on what teams have the highest chances so far base on their
current records.

Rams
----

The Rams have a spot already guaranteed for the playoffs after their win on
12/2/2018. No other team can currently beat get more wins than what the Rams 
currently have. The Rams can *potentially* win out the rest of their games and 
secure home field advantage for all of their playoff games. The Rams have been 
averaging about 35 points a game. The it is crucial that **Todd Gurley** stays
healthy and remains with no injury for the Rams to find Success even though
they proven they can do well with the passing game against the Cheifs in week
11.

Saints
------

The Saints should have their spot secured for their division in the up coming 
weeks, but after the upset they faced against the Cowboys this week they will
have to wait to secure it. The Panthers will have to win out while the saints 
lose the remaining of their games which is highly unlikely. With players like
**Drew Brees**, **Alvin Kamara**, and **Michael Thomas** the saints have good Offensive 
weapons to tackle upcoming games. The offensive line for the saints could use
improvement so **Drew Brees** can have more time to make a play if they wish to
make it all the way to the *Super Bowl*.


Chiefs
------

The Chiefs had to release **Kareem Hunt** which was their star running back after
video evidence being released of him abusing a female in a hotel. He is predicted
to have a 6 week suspension from the NFL and will have to be picked up by a 
different team. The Chiefs are still very strong with their quarter back 
**Patrick Mahomes**, their extremely fast wide receiver **Tyreek Hill**, and
tight end **Travis Kelce**. The chiefs are looking to win their division but
will have to maintain their 1 game lead over the Chargers. If the Chiefs lose their
division top seed they still have good odds of getting in the wild card.

Patriots
--------

I mean they are the Patriots.

Chargers
